The goal of this exercise is to run a Nexus application on GCP Kubernetes, that can save the uploaded artifacts in Cloud Storage. 

Build a custom container
You do not have to start from scratch, since Nexus has an image already prepared here: https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3/
Nexus needs a plugin to write into Cloud Storage. You can find its description here: https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-blobstore-google-cloud
Create a Docker file, which makes an image, where the Cloud Storage plugin is already properly installed.

    [] Dockerfile is available in my Git repo

Kubernetes deploy
We want to deploy the previously created custom container to Kubernetes, but for that we need a descriptor file. Make a yaml configuration file, that lets you to create the next units: Service, Persistence Volume, Deployment.

    [] kubernetes descripter file in yaml format is available in my Git repo. So you just need to run below command if you have 3 node cluster already running.
            # kubectl create -f deploy-nexus-kubernetes.yaml
            

Automated script
We will need a runnable script, that allows us to install the entire application from zero, if we have the aforementioned script and the right permissions. Please be mindful about the new Nexus versions, that you will have to deploy to the existing environment (after modifying the necessary files).
Write a script, that automates the next processes: container build, container push, kubernetes setup, deploy.

    [] "automated-script.sh" is available in my Git repo

Continuous integration - theoretical question
It is possible, that we have to modify the previously created files, for example because of a new Nexus version. We want this to automatically be deployed to a test environment after we made the changes on Git.
Please describe in a few words, how would you satisfy this need.

    [] Yes, its possible by using Jenkins along with Git module. Already did it many times and a sample copy is also placed in my other git repo.
